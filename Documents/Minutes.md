#### Meeting 2: May 16th

* __Things to be discussed__:
  1. EAPI discussions proposal: Adding a post_install test script in the ebuild.
     To be proposed for EAPI 7 / Any other method ---?
  2. Using Docker inside docker instead of docker installed by BOINC client:
     Instead of the client downloading and installing docker
     (which would cause problems dependent on OS and package manager), a docker
     image containing only BOINC client and DOCKER installed should be used. For
     stabilization, docker containers inside the main docker container should be used.
  3. USE flag combinations: [SAT-Solver for REQ_USE](
     https://github.com/pallavagarwal07/SummerOfCode16/blob/master/satsolver/solver.py)
  4. Resources to learn Portage API??
* __TODO__:
  1. Compare Docker { Client + Docker { container (s) } }
     vs Docker { Client } + Docker { container (s) } DONE
  2. Check out docker-compose DONE
  3. Maybe check rkt (after trying all of the above)
  4. Continue discussion about EAPI upgrade vs. separate scripts especially with package manager maintainers
  5. Try REST api of Bugzilla DONE
  6. Find out how to use Portage API DONE (A LITTLE)  or Gentoolkit API
